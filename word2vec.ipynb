    "# Introducing Distributed Word Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "Word2vec, published by Google in 2013, is a neural network implementation that learns distributed representations for words. Other deep or recurrent neural network architectures had been proposed for learning word representations prior to this, but the major problem with these was the long time required to train the models. Word2vec learns quickly relative to other models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Word2Vec does not need labels in order to create meaningful representations. This is useful, since most data in the real world is unlabeled. If the network is given enough training data (tens of billions of words), it produces word vectors with intriguing characteristics. Words with similar meanings appear in clusters, and clusters are spaced such that some word relationships, such as analogies, can be reproduced using vector math. The famous example is that, with highly trained word vectors, \"king - man + woman = queen.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Google's code, writeup, and the accompanying papers:\n",
    "* https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/\n",
    "* https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B7XkCwpI5KDYRWRnd1RzWXQ2TWc/edit\n",
    "\n",
    "The original code is in C, but it has since been ported to other languages, including Python. We encourage you to play with the original C tool, but be warned that it is not user-friendly if you are a beginning programmer (we had to manually edit the header files to compile it).\n",
    "\n",
    "Distributed word vectors are powerful and can be used for many applications, particularly word prediction and translation. Here, we will try to apply them to sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using word2vec in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we will use the excellent implementation of word2vec from the gensim package. If you don't already have gensim installed, you'll need to install it. There is an excellent tutorial that accompanies the Python Word2Vec implementation:Â https://rare-technologies.com/word2vec-tutorial/\n",
    "\n",
    "Although Word2Vec does not require graphics processing units (GPUs) like many deep learning algorithms, it is compute intensive. Both Google's version and the Python version rely on multi-threading (running multiple processes in parallel on your computer to save time). ln order to train your model in a reasonable amount of time, you will need to install cython (instructions here). Word2Vec will run without cython installed, but it will take days to run instead of minutes."

    "3. **Downsampling of frequent words**: The Google documentation recommends values between .00001 and .001. For us, values closer 0.001 seemed to improve the accuracy of the final model.\n",
    "4. **Word vector dimensionality**: More features result in longer runtimes, and often, but not always, result in better models. Reasonable values can be in the tens to hundreds; we used 300.\n",
    "5. **Context / window size**: How many words of context should the training algorithm take into account? 10 seems to work well for hierarchical softmax (more is better, up to a point).\n",
    "Worker threads: Number of parallel processes to run. This is computer-specific, but between 4 and 6 should work on most systems.\n",
    "Minimum word count: This helps limit the size of the vocabulary to meaningful words. Any word that does not occur at least this many times across all documents is ignored. Reasonable values could be between 10 and 100. In this case, since each movie occurs 30 times, we set the minimum word count to 40, to avoid attaching too much importance to individual movie titles. This resulted in an overall vocabulary size of around 15,000 words. Higher values also help limit run time.\n",

A standard way of weighting word vectors is to apply \"tf-idf\" weights, which measure how important a given word is within a given set of documents. One way to extract tf-idf weights in Python is by using scikit-learn's TfidfVectorizer, which has an interface similar to the CountVectorizer that we used in Part 1. However, when we tried weighting our word vectors in this way, we found no substantial improvement in performance."
